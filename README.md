## Technology
During creating the website I was using Visual Studio Code and I used a BEM convention, ES6+ Features. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was created to response correctly on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices thanks to using media queries. I used fonts available on Google Fonts, Sharing debugger and flexbox and grid convention.
